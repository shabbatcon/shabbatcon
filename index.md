![Shabbat con logo](shabbatcon.logo.png)

We are a group of religious Jews who get together at Defcon each year. We are trying to provide the infrastructure for religious Jews to attend the con by organizing minyanim, seudot, a track of talks on shabbat afternoon, and more. It's a great gathering that can be a welcome respite from the crazy crowds at Defcon and an opportunity to discuss some very unique perspectives on hacking.
